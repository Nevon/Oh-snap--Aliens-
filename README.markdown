#Oh Snap, README!

##The Game
_Oh Snap, Aliens!_ is a space shooter with the highly unique and revolutionizing 
goal of defending earth from a seemingly unstoppable and neverending onslaught
of alien attackers.

Unlike other games in the genre, _Oh Snap, Aliens!_ doesn't give you unlimited
ammunition. Instead, you have to conserve your missiles so that you don't
run out right when there's a ufo in your sights. In return for this
inconveniance, the ship has the ability to aim its weapons 180 degrees.

###Technical stuff
The game is written in [Lua](http://www.lua.org/ "The Programming Language Lua"), using the [Löve framework](http://www.love2d.org/ "LÖVE - Free 2d Game Engine").
In order to run it, you'll first need to install Löve (unless you're using one 
of the stand-alone executables that I may or may not have put in the downloads
section). More information on that can be found on the [LÖVE wiki](http://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page "Löve Wiki") where
you can also find information on how to run the game.

###Current status
_Oh Snap, Aliens!_ is still very much in its infancy. It was born just three
days ago (as of Mars 15, 2010), so I suppose calling it 0.1 would be an 
insult to any version 0.1 software out there. 

The newest info regarding this game can always be found at the [LÖVE forums](http://love2d.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1417 "Oh Snap, Aliens! forum thread").
